Change the functionality of searching for reviews from the frontend to the backend

Backend:

Add review average over time

perform outlier detection by creating a review vector fro each week (dimensions are the star ratings)

add a blacklist of reviewers to exclude

use documentIntelligence to scan menus and add benchmarking. Maybe callouts like "cheapest samosas in town"?

add callouts like top 5% of restaurants in the search 

suggest an dish to try using chatgpt and the reviews. Maybe add the price as well once menus are analyzed.

Frontend:

Add window to display information.

Places should get a mini Card
